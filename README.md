# Image-Classification

Here are repository of Image Classification with state-of-the-art techniques (Fourier Neural Operator, FNO/ U-Net, etc) orororor Transfer Learning Model

I' m now tackling on any renowned algorithm to modeling MNIST, cifar10, food101 classifier. (ImageNet) 

Hope you enjoy my works !

Benchmarks on Food 101 datasets: https://tensorboard.dev/experiment/MVceQhnBTXC6d2rGEh9G9w/#scalars
